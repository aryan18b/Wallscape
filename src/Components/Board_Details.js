            Ocean. It's considered one of the world's foremost destinations for
            wildlife-viewing. A province of Ecuador, it lies about 1,000km off
            its coast. Its isolated terrain shelters a diversity of plant and
            animal species, many found nowhere else. Charles Darwin visited in
            1835, and his observation of Gal치pagos' species later inspired his
            theory of evolution.`,

        description: `purple, pink, and blue ued lupin flowers may not be native to New Zealand (they hail from North America), they really do seem to bloom most vibrantly on the Oceanian nation's South Island. At Lake Tekapo, in particular, the flowers juxtapose against the backdrop of the crystal clear water to create one of the country's most stunning vistas.`,
